### Overview: ###

The challenge is to build a simulated sushi shop server-side program that takes orders from the 
customers, processes the orders in parallel, shows and updates the order status. 

The program built a server to create and update orders by restful APIs based on springboot and simulated the behavior of 
three chefs to cook by a thread pool.

The following frameworks/libraries/tools were used in the program:

- Spring boot 2.5.6
- H2 database
- Maven/Gradle
